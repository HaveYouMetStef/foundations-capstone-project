# Foundations-capstone-project
As part of Devmountain's Part-time Foundations Course, I've decided to create a website that had meaning to me. As a fragrance owner/connoisseur,
I thought it would be a cool idea to create a website where I get to demonstrate the colognes I currently own. As well as, create a few features that will
allow for users to add a cologne by submitting a form with their frangrances name and image URL. Users are also able to rate their frangrances from 1 - 5, also adjust their rating after the submission. Finally, users are able to the remove fragrances from the web page after the fragrance has been submitted.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, Express.JS, JSON

I hope you all enjoy this project, any critiques would be appreciated.
